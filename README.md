## What is YelpCamp
##### YelpCamp is a website where users can create and review campgrounds. In order to review or create a campground, you must have an account. This is a camping ground website which was actually developed during a code-along while following the-web-developer-bootcamp. This project was created using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Bootstrap. Passport.js was used to handle authentication.
